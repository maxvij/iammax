## Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio is built with Gatsby. 

#### Development
Assuming you have the latest `npm`, `node` (`nvm`) installed, run the following:

`$ npm install`

`$ gatsby develop`

Open `localhost:8000` in your browser.

#### Production
To make a production build, use `$ gatsby build` and transfer the contents of the `public` folder.
